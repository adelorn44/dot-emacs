* Dot Emacs
This is my configuration for Emacs.
* Installation
For installing Emacs, follow the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][official guide]].
Then, clone this repository under ~/.emacs.d

To do so, execute the following command:
+ git clone git@github.com:adelorn44/dot-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
* Customizations
You may change some variables in src/my-customize-init.el to fit to
your needs. I tried to put some reasonable defaults.
* Project structure
** Init file
At startup, Emacs will load ~/.emacs.d/init.el by default.
** Elisp code
My Emacs Lisp code is under src/my-helpers.el
*** Testing
*Unit tests* for my Elisp code are under tests/test-*unit-test*.el
** Mode customization
Each customized Emacs major *mode* has a configuration under
src/my-*mode*.el
